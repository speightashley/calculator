# Calculator Project

## Project from the foundations course of The Odin Project

This project was built with semantic HTML, CSS3 and Javascript

I utilised Flexbox to build the front end and styled it like an IPhone

It's the second project I have built with Javascript so I may have to do some refactoring later on when I understand more about structures of apps.

As it stands, there are sections in the script.js file that handle:

- Element grabbing with consts
- Global Variable section
- Event Listeners
- Functions

That's a note to myself for when I get more comfortable with the proper layout of a front end JS file.

I think the CSS file could do with a little more organisation as there are shared properties over a few elements that could be broken down into classes.
Same as JS, I will come back to refactor once I have learnt more CSS.
